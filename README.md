# clipboard-monitor
Keeps a copy of everything saved to your clipboard

The first time you run this, cd into this folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required library.

Then to run the file, type `python clip.py`

Then just run it in the background. 

It's a short script, but very useful :)
